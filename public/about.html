<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently in the final year of my MEng Biomedical Engineering program at the University of Reading, where I have developed a strong foundation in both engineering principles and medical technology. My academic journey has fueled my interest in the intersection of technology and healthcare, particularly in software engineering, which I am actively pursuing alongside my studies.</p>

<p>As a self-taught programmer, I am currently focused on front-end development, honing my skills in designing intuitive user interfaces and enhancing user experience. My goal is to transition towards full-stack development to gain a comprehensive understanding of both client-side and server-side technologies. I thrive in challenging environments, driven by a hardworking and proactive mindset. With a strong "can-do" attitude, I am continuously exploring new tools and frameworks to expand my skill set and take on complex projects that push my limits.</p>

<p>I am eager to contribute to innovative projects that bridge the gap between healthcare and technology, while refining my software engineering expertise</p>
